Overview
--------

The V-Model is a systems development model that emphasizes verification and validation at each stage of development. 
In automobile testing, this model ensures that each requirement is thoroughly tested and validated before moving to 
the next phase.

Key Principles
--------------

* **Early Testing**: Testing activities are planned in parallel with development phases
* **Traceability**: Each test phase corresponds to a development phase
* **Quality Assurance**: Continuous verification and validation throughout the lifecycle
* **Risk Mitigation**: Early detection of defects reduces cost and time
